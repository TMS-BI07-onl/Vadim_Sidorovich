Well done!

Homework
Your solution is correct, but there is a much easier way to filter out NULLs:
...
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND IrinaPashkovich IS NOT NULL
THEN INSERT...

The information about authors is not needed in the task, so join to authors can be deleted.
Also, I think, you accidently get the correct answer :)
What I mean: probably, you wanted to SUM(quantity_books). By books quantity I meant кол-во экземпляров and the task was to calculate number of different books. So, thats why count will return my expected result. It will have same answer as COUNT (book_id) if we assume that quantity_books is not null.

Your code will return all books for an author and count of their orders. But I just want to see 1 book for an author.
