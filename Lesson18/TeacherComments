Well done!

1. -1.5
Correct answer:
SELECT man.first_name, man.cast_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) as cnt_of_emp
FROM employees man JOIN employees emp ON man.employee_id=emp.manager_id
GROUP BY man.first_name, man.cast_name
HAVING COUNT(emp.employee_id)>6

3. -1
For this code you'll need group by.
Also, max count of employees should be calculating for regions, not for employees.
One of correct answers:
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES region_name
FROM Employees e JOIN Departments d ON dep.department_id=emp.department_id
	JOIN Locations l ON d.location_id=l.location_id
	JOIN Countries c ON l.country_id=c.country_id
	JOIN Regions r ON c.region_id=r.region_id 
GROUP BY region_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC

5. -0.5
having clause is useless. 
Second solution won't work. What is year in the select?
